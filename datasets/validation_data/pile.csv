-“Zoophiles” are now coming out of the closet. A very lengthy article on this entitled “Those Who Practice Bestiality Say They’re Part of the Next Sexual Rights Movement” has gone into quite a bit of detail on this. It begins this way: “During his sophomore year in high school, Cody Beck finally got fed up with hearing homophobic cracks. If his classmates thought being gay was weird (Beck was openly bisexual), he had a confession that would blow their minds. He told them he is sexually attracted to dogs and horses.

“‘I just couldn’t keep it in anymore, Beck says. Just for the hell of it, I figured I’d throw it out there and have them make fun of me even more. Which they did. An 18-year-old from Arizona who graduated from high school this past year, Beck says classmates taunted",Pile-CC

Paul said via blog that he was ""floored and sky-high"" about the free-market solution to the debt problem, praising it as an exciting workaround to the Federal Reserve's monopoly stranglehold. He assured his hundreds of millions of supporters that any excess above campaign costs would be promptly directed to pay down the deficit-- as long as the trend continues, and as soon as they can figure out how to do it under Federal Election Commission regulations.

Incidentally, the Federal Election Commission had no comment, but a brief which appeared under ""Recent Regulatory Activity"" on their website may be responsive to Paul's unique situation. Last night via this link the FEC promulgated regulations creating an ""improper format"" fine on election reports that show receipts in excess of the permitted numeric character count of eleven digits (including pence).

So to compare, an assumption needs to be made, that staking scales linearly with balance. This assumption may be wrong, and in fact, the article above explains on how this assumption is, in fact, wrong. However, it shouldnt be too wrong when scaling from 16M to 22M divi as it’s only a small fraction of an order of magnitude.

The staking rewards in both are dropping, and there really isn’t much of a difference between the two besides a few points. So, empirically, breaking up a large amount into different wallets doesn’t seem to pan out as a better staking method.

How about staking versus masternnodes? Does that relationship still make staking look better?

You'll never have to buy replacement bulbs because LED bulbs can last for 30-50,000 hours ... at least 15-20 years with 5 hours per day of use. Imagine the cost savings not having to buy 10 sets of replacement bulbs in that time, plus saving trips to the store and dealing with the inconvenience of old-fashioned lighting!

LED bulbs require much less electrical energy - only a few watts per bulb. Your electrical bill will be lower as a result. If you're put off by LED because of the price, consider it a long-term payoff - overall you will save by joining the LED revolution today!

Schema markups are a powerful way to optimize your website for SERPs. It’s basically a code that you put on your website to help search engines provide more informative search results to users.

Schema markups can make your web pages appear more prominently in SERPs for all kinds of content. You can use data markup for articles, local businesses, restaurants, book reviews, events, and products.

Why is passing $(this) as a parameter not working

How come the following line:

Practical use of the Detection Limit (DL) is related to the decision whether to integrate or disregard the peak on the chromatogram, and is very closely related to the evaluation of the S/N ratio. ICH guideline Q2R1 defines the DL as the minimum level of analyte which can be readily detected ([@CR6]). For chromatographic methods, a signal to noise ratio of 3 is generally considered acceptable for estimating the detection limit. This approach is straightforward and allows for dynamic assessment of DL for each individual chromatogram based on the extracted information about the amplitude level of the noise.

Using a variety of different biochemical methods we have obtained evidence that YidC exists in a homooligomeric form similar to that observed for its mitochondrial homolog (a protein called Oxa1p). The results suggest that YidC is a multisubunit complex that could function as a protein conducting channel. In addition, recent results indicate",NIH ExPorter

Freddie Mercury sings about shooting people with a ‘rubber Tommy water gun’, while James Hetfield’s shooter is ‘fully-loaded’. And there’s a couple of ‘fuck’s added for good measure. The song later appeared on the B-side of their Enter Sandman single the following year, and scooped a GRAMMY for Best Metal Performance. At The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert for AIDS Awareness in 1991, a guitar-free Hetfield joined Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi and the surviving members of Queen for the song in front of a sold-out Wembley Stadium, as well as TV and radio audiences in 76 countries around the world.

As such it will primarily monitor frontal lobe cortical electrical activity and indirectly frontal cerebral perfusion.

The existence of viruses that infect bacteria was first recognized by Frederick Twort in 1911, and, independently, by Felix d'Herelle in 1917. Since bacteria could be grown easily in culture, this led to an explosion of virology research. An important investigator in this area, Max Delbrück, described the basic life cycle of a virus in 1937: rather than ""growing"", a virus particle is assembled from its constituent pieces in one step; eventually it leaves the host cell to infect other cells.

One edge of this rectangular counting frame was placed at the gyral crown, and four underlying zones (each 1.25 mm) were demarcated medially toward the sulcal depth.

Interestingly, all identified hybrids had an intermediate flight period that was within the period of time during which both *C. fumiferana* and *C. occidentalis* were flying.

At first glance, $24,000 a year seems like an 8 percent annual return. But the payment is made up of the return of your principal as well as interest, so the actual return is lower—and will vary depending on how long you live.

For example, if you live for another 18 years, this annuity's annual yield is 4.45%. If you live to 90, the annual return goes to about 6.6%. If you live to 95, it's 7.3%.

To locate flocks, we surveyed the study area by vehicle, working either from before sunrise until midday or from midday until sunset. Our aim was to locate flocks associated with the plantations in order to undertake behavioural observations. We chose not to follow a follow a systematic survey route or to stratify survey effort by habitat type because the size and layout of the plantation system made it impractical to assess spatial distribution using a vehicle-based survey (cf the use of feeding trace). When birds were observed, we conducted a 5--10 minute 'behavioural survey' to collect location, behavioural (e.g. activity state), abundance, and habitat data.

Antarctica is a land full of strange marine animals whose populations persist through incredible seasonality. Five months each of sunlight and dark provide times of plenty - and long periods of famine. However, in the High Antarctic invertebrate communities thrive. Learn how these invertebrates shift their diets in order to survive, from plankton to fascinating kinds of bacteria. Prof. Thurber's story may be set against an Antarctic backdrop, but it provides an analog for some of the largest and most important habitats on our planet with implications for our carbon legacy and the continued functioning of our planet as a whole.

On this appeal, Pennell has relied solely upon the second theory used by defendants who seek use immunity for witnesses.  This theory, which has been accepted by the Third Circuit, is that the federal courts have inherent power to immunize witnesses whose testimony is essential to an effective defense.  This power is said to exist independently of the prosecutor's prerogative to grant statutory use immunity to witnesses and is to be exercised in order to protect the truthfinding function of the criminal trial.

South Sudan has agreed to the deployment of a 4,000-strong regional protection force approved by the U.N. Security Council after first rejecting the peacekeepers as a violation of its sovereignty.

Sunday's announcement came after the Security Council met with South Sudan President Salva Kiir in Juba, the capital, during a rare visit to the turbulent East African country.

It opens the door for higher-level intimacy, where you learn how to make love with the Divine and your partner at the same time. Beyond a purely physical exchange, you make love with your partner at the physical, emotional, mental and spiritual levels.

Unbalanced Expression of Love

Sentimentality is the main component of an unbalanced Fourth Chakra. The ""bleeding heart"" is unable to separate her problems from those of others. Thus her connection with others is unhealthy and painful. Doing things for others as the price for being accepted is the common result of this imbalance.

Over-attachment in love and codependency are examples of imbalances when the needs for security of the lower chakras interfere with the natural expression of love. Love becomes need and loses much of its shine. ""I love you"" is being said, but ""I need you""",Books3

However, we consider it unlikely that patients would report certain signs like cataract or glaucoma without having a diagnoses made by an ophthalmologist. As the symptoms begin gradually, over many years, and many patients have a spectrum of different symptoms, memorizing the exact starting point of each symptom is subject to recall error. For this reason, the given years of onset must be taken as rough estimates in most cases. Secondly, patients were recruited through a disease-specific patient organisation. Patients registered as members might differ from those who declined such activities, as might patients who returned and did not return the phase II questionnaire either because they had less health problems or were more debilitated.

However, further studies are needed as its effects may be limited to distinct NMD-sensitive transcript variants.

Only a single USER code, or one tier system, has been reported for SRSF3 despite the fact it recruits mRNAs to different machineries. The features that allow recruitment to the appropriate machinery are not yet known, so it is possible that a second USER code(s) is required.

==========

We have shown how to compute time-periodic solutions of the free-surface Euler equations with improved resolution, accuracy and robustness by formulating the shooting method as an overdetermined nonlinear least squares problem and exploiting parallelism in the Jacobian calculation. This made it possible to resolve a long-standing open question, posed by Penney and Price in 1952, on whether the most extreme standing wave develops wave crests with sharp 90 degree corners each time the fluid comes to rest. Previous numerical studies reached different conclusions about the form of the limiting wave, but none were able to resolve the fine-scale oscillations that develop due to resonant effects. While we cannot say for certain that no standing wave exists that forms sharp corners at",ArXiv

When two waveguides are close one to each other there is a non-zero overlap between the modes of the waveguides. By choosing the waveguide separation and the length of the coupling region, it is possible to choose the amount of power that goes to one waveguide to the other (coupling ratio).

In effect, short-acting opioids can address any breakthrough pain, and long-acting opioids can function as a stable baseline of pain management. As postoperative pain begins to diminish, reducing the dosage of a short-acting opioid seems to be an effective method in reducing the total dose of opioids administered daily.

Because such opioids as methadone with long half-lives can gradually accumulate, titration of the drugs should be done with care, in order to avoid overdose. Postoperatively, administering 1.5-fold the preoperative opioid dose orally, in addition to patient-controlled analgesic intravenous opioids for breakthrough pain, until the surgical pain begins to diminish has proved an effective method.

Output from a sequence identification pipeline not only depends upon the databases against which sequences are searched, but also upon the strategies used for filtering the raw data, for searching the databases, and for counter-screening the primary hits. In any case, the sequence identification pipeline will produce a listing of sequences that match one or more taxonomies above some threshold measure of confidence, and a listing of sequences that do no match any taxonomies above that threshold.

One component required by such systems, and more broadly by most electronics systems employing the use of electromagnetic waves in general, is a device capable of directing the wave energy in a particular direction. In a radar system, for example, the beam frequently must be swept in azimuth and elevation, while the antenna in a communications system often must be directed toward a receiving unit.

Doping has been adopted as a versatile approach for tuning the adhesion of metal oxide/metal interfaces. Understanding the mechanism of doping at the interface adhesion on the atomic and electronic scale is crucial for the rational design and optimization of metal oxide/metal composites. In this work, we have investigated the effects of dopants on the adhesion of SnO2/Cu interfaces through first-principles calculations. Firstly, O-terminated a SnO2(110)/Cu(111) interface (denoted as I) was considered and the work of separation values of the interfaces with various dopants (Mo, Sb, Ti, Zn and Cu) were calculated to evaluate the interface adhesion strength.

Breast cancer may manifest as microcalcifications in x-ray mammography. Small microcalcifications, essential to the early detection of breast cancer, are often obscured by overlapping tissue structures. Dual-energy imaging, where separate low- and high-energy images are acquired and synthesized to cancel the tissue structures, may improve the ability to detect and visualize microcalcifications. Transmission measurements at two different kVp values were made on breast-tissue-equivalent materials under narrow-beam geometry using an indirect flat-panel mammographic imager. The imaging scenario consisted of variable aluminum thickness (to simulate calcifications) and variable glandular ratio (defined as the ratio of the glandular-",Pile-CC

We found that CuZnSOD-deficient mice exhibit accelerated vascular aging and impaired neovascularization in response to ischemia.

Comparing the gate time, $\tau$, to the shortest relaxation time, $T_2$, we have observed that in both cases it will be possible to perform about thousands quantum gate operations before the system decoheres. This is our main result. As far as we are aware, this result indicates that our system could be the most favorable for the realization of a quantum gate.

Over the past five years, we've put an end to ""too big to fail"", and we've made sure taxpayers are no longer on the hook for Wall Street's reckless behavior. The landmark Wall Street Reform law did two things. First, it made sure our banks are less risky and better capitalized, which means they are less likely to fail. Second, it created new authorities to make sure regulators have the tools they need to wind down banks in an orderly manner in the event they do fail. This means no more bailouts, and it means no more ""too big to fail.""

Today, our banks hold more and better-quality capital than they did before the crisis. In fact, new rules will require the largest banks to hold even more capital.

Among community-dwelling older women, compared to those without Parkinson's disease (PD), women with PD have 7.3% lower BMD and an increased risk for hip fracture (HR = 2.6). Studies reporting an association of Parkinson's disease (PD) with low bone mineral density (BMD) and increased fracture risk often have been prone to selection bias, and have not accounted for potentially important explanatory variables, including recent weight loss. Further, little is known about the association between PD and non-hip fractures. Consequently, we investigated the independent association of PD with hip BMD and long-term fracture risk. Associations of self-reported PD with hip BMD and incident hip and non-spine, non-hip fracture were analyzed using linear regression and Cox proportional hazards, respectively.

If b = 0, ILP is independent of amplitude; if b \> 0, ILP will decrease with increasing amplitude; oppositely, if b \< 0, ILP will increase with increasing amplitude. In this work, ILP decreases with increasing amplitude, and the reason may be the positive intercept b obtained for 4.3 nm MHFn (b = 14.0) and for 4.8 nm MHFn (b = 10.6).

Introduction
============

Given a sequence of distinct positive integers $v_1,v_2,\ldots$ and any positive integer $n$, the discriminator $D_v(n)$ is defined as the smallest positive integer $m$ such $v_1,\ldots,v_n$ are pairwise incongruent modulo $m$. Browkin and Cao [@BC] relate it to cancellations algorithms similar to the sieve of Eratosthenes.\
The main problem is to give an easy description or characterization of $D_v(n)$ (in many cases such a characterization does not seem to exist). Arnold, Benkoski and McCabe [@ABM] might have been the first to consider this type of problem (they introduced also the name). They considered the case where $v_j=j",ArXiv

Considering two-dimensional (2D) materials subjected to pure shear, we find that the low-frequency modes are always peaked in point-like “soft spots”, where the next ST will take place. This extreme localisation is at variance with short-range depinning models, where soft modes have a finite localisation length which can be tuned by playing with the disorder strength [@cao2017localisation; @Tanguy2004localisation].

These meetings will later form the basis for the peer circles of self-managed projects (and part of the basis for escaping wage slavery). There may be several such groups in one shop. It is only through face-to-face associations like these that an autonomous opposition culture can once again be generated. Even if you start with only half-a-dozen people, word will get around that there is a meeting where the problems of the workplace are being discussed. This will become the focal point of a consciousness that is opposed to corporate culture. Without this counterconsciousness, there is no possibility of effective opposition.

The Iranian border city of Mehran, on the foot of the Zagros Mountains, was selected as the first target.

To Perez, it is more practical and, importantly, more instructive to 'identify the social and cultural contexts in which the physician is embedded' (p. 12). Historical texts about physicians are typically normative or prescriptive, swinging between satire and panegyric. To overcome this obstacle and achieve a more nuanced synthesis, Perez chooses to play with the scales of time. Aware of the difficulties of this exercise, especially of the risk of giving readers an impression of only superficial glimpses, Perez affirms his choices.

Three years in the making and involving artists from here and abroad, 24 Frames per Second is an important exhibition that, in the words of its organisers, “works at the intersection of dance, film and visual arts”. It’s not, however, dance as many people might understand it. Co-curator Nina Miall acknowledges there was much discussion about how it might be defined: “It’s a broad understanding,” she says with some understatement. Not only does this understanding encompass the body in motion or even simply the presence of gesture – an exceptionally generous definition of dance – but also something more metaphorical, as in “the dance between analogue and digital”. One might even like to see the collaborations between artists who usually work in different fields from one another as a form of dance.

As part of the deal, Southwest Sports Group assumed part-ownership of both the team and the ballpark to be built following the 2002 season. The project, designed by David M. Schwarz Architectural Services and HKS Sports & Entertainment Group, broke ground on February 6, 2002.

The ballpark serves as the anchor for a  $300 million development project near the intersection of State Highway 121 and the Dallas North Tollway. The project was jointly funded by the city of Frisco and Southwest Sports Group.

Lack of recovery from protein synthesis inhibition (PSI) closely correlates with neuronal death following brain ischemia and reperfusion. It has therefore been suggested that understanding the mechanisms of PSI will shed light on the mechanisms of selective neuronal death following ischemia and reperfusion. It is now known that the PKR-like ER kinase (PERK)-mediated phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha) causes translation inhibition at initial reperfusion. Activation of PERK, in turn, indicates endoplasmic reticulum stress and activation of the unfolded protein response. However, phosphorylation of eIF2alpha is a transient event and can account for PSI only in the initial hours of reperfusion.

With the increasing development of digitalized generation, the data storage density for the conventional data storage media might become unsatisfactory soon for receiving and storing a great amount of data. For dealing with such a problem, a single data storage medium with a very large quantity of storage capacity or a plurality of data storage media are used in a computer system. Conventionally, data stored in a data storage medium are read via a disk drive that is operated mechanically. Therefore, the operating speed of the disk drive likely fails to catch up with the high processing speed of the central processing unit (CPU). For matching the operating speed of the disk drive and the processing speed of the central processing unit, a configuration of RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disk) is proposed.

This brilliant film classic was one of the highlights of the careers of both director Visconti and French actor Alain Delon. Its style grows out of the Italian postwar neo-realist movement, but it is not quite as gritty looking as most of those. The story concerns a family of four very poor but closely-connected brothers and their mother who move from the back country of southern Italy to Milan after the death of their hard-working father. The mothers hope is to give them a chance to improve the familys fortunes in the big city. The brothers all struggle to make it in their unfamiliar new world and Rocco and his older brother both fall for the same woman with disasterous consequences. Rocco seems too saintly in his extreme self",Pile-CC

The escalating physical threats exchanged among the Marquess of Queensberry, Lord Alfred Douglas, and Oscar Wilde ended—logically, in the law's eyes—in Wilde's summoning Queensberry to criminal court, where a jury took the place of a bullet as decision maker.

Furthermore, when we divided our antisocial group into those with particularly low prefrontal gray volumes and those with near-normal volumes, we found that it was the former group—those with the structural prefrontal impairment—who particularly showed somatic-marker deficits. We were finding an interesting convergence of somatic-marker impairments, prefrontal structural deficits, and antisocial behavior that bore a striking resemblance to the findings on Damasio and Bechara's patients.

The second issue concerned the localization of the structural impairment. Where exactly within the prefrontal cortex did our antisocial, psychopathic individuals have reduced gray-matter volume?

Tidal forces are stronger closer to the halo centre, so that the contribution to the ICL from stripping and/or disruption of massive galaxies is more significant than that from low mass satellites. The latter tend to spend larger fractions of their lifetimes at the outskirts of their parent halo, where tidal stripping is weaker.

The differences between predictions from models Disr. and Tid. and those from model Cont. Strip. are due to a combination of different effects. On one side, model Cont. Strip. uses a different merger time prescription that leads to significantly shorter merger times than in models Disr. and Tid. This is particularly important for the most massive satellites that have the shortest merger times.

On 5 November 1984, the first interim Tornado F2 was first delivered to the RAF, and its short career came to an end shortly following the improved Tornado F3 entered service. These aircraft were used primarily for training by No. 229 Operational Conversion Unit until they were placed in storage. The F2s were intended to be updated to Tornado F2A standard (similar to the F3 but without the engine upgrade) but only one F2A, the Tornado Integrated Avionics Research Aircraft (TIARA) was converted, having been customised by QinetiQ for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trials at MoD Boscombe Down.

Above all, according to Beck, a war against the western powers would rapidly develop into a European war, indeed into a world war. Although Germany would certainly win a campaign against Czechoslovakia, it would lose the war.

Organic electronic devices that emit light, such as light-emitting diodes that make up displays, are present in many different kinds of electronic equipment. In all such devices, an organic active layer is sandwiched between two electrical contact layers. At least one of the electrical contact layers is light-transmitting so that light can pass through the electrical contact layer. The organic active layer emits light through the light-transmitting electrical contact layer upon application of electricity across the electrical contact layers.

This philosophical understanding of sexual violence, as a fundamentally social crime, has become more vital than ever in the days since the Kavanaugh and Ford testimonies. The hearings gripped the country; everywhere from nursing homes to the New York Stock Exchange, people stopped what they were doing to watch these two people speak.

The way Ford’s allegations are handled, then, will help define our national understanding of sexual assault for years to come. Do men enjoy superior standing, a presumption of truth-telling denied to female accusers? Just how seriously does our political system take accusations of sexual assault and violence? Are credible allegations disqualifying for the most significant legal body in the country?

Similarly, subjects who participated only 1 day in the dietary studies, when the protocol prescribed more reporting days per individual, were also excluded for the chronic exposure assessment. Not all countries provided consumption information for all age groups, and in some cases the same country provided more than one consumption survey.

For calculating chronic dietary exposure to DAS, food consumption and body weight data at the individual level were accessed in the Comprehensive Database. Occurrence data and consumption data were linked at the relevant FoodEx level.

The mean and the high (95th percentile) chronic dietary exposures were calculated by combining DAS mean occurrence values for food samples collected in different countries (pooled European occurrence data) with the average daily consumption for each food at individual level in each dietary survey and age class.

Their red blood cells, carrying oxygen, remain fully loaded: 100 percent saturated. But all that heavy breathing lowers the concentration of carbon dioxide—the gas we exhale. We actually need a certain amount of carbon dioxide circulating in our blood; if the carbon dioxide is too low, the brain responds by squeezing and shrinking the small blood vessels.

### Standing Poses: Strength and Flexibility

Nowhere in the catalog of yoga asanas do the twin qualities of _sthira_ and _sukha_ —stability and mobility, strength and flexibility—shine more than in the standing poses. Moving in and out of the poses requires and builds isotonic strength, and holding them provides isometric exercise.

They do not feel that middle-class black Americans have genuinely developed self-respect. In other words, they are acting white to guard against being discriminated against by white America or to prevent being harassed by police. The article accuses middle-class black Americans of not wanting to associate with poor blacks because of that fear:

8574," meta-analysis is precisely what was needed in attachment research, as the field had hit the saturation stage foreseen by van IJzendoorn and Tavecchio in [@bibr28-0963721420904967]. In this stage, many of the major questions seemed to have been settled and, despite countless but fragmented efforts, progress was slow in resolving the remaining gaps. Combining data from primary studies, whether large or small, capitalized on the benefits of this saturation stage and offered exciting prospects for the renewal of the attachment-research paradigm ([@bibr4-0963721420904967]).

We started the Collaboration on Attachment Transmission Synthesis (CATS) to both overcome stagnation in understanding intergenerational transmission of attachment and to test the feasibility of IPD meta-analysis for our field.

When the field is parallel to the $a$-axis, the temperature dependence of the Knight shift at both sites is relatively small. This result suggests that the spin susceptibility along the $a$-axis is much smaller than those along the $b$- and $c$- axes since $^{m}A_i$ is considered to be isotropic in this system.

4672," this worsens the situation for some other individual, who in turn also cuts his spending.

A vicious circle then emerges — the decline in people’s confidence causes them to spend less and to hoard more money. This lowers economic activity further, thereby causing people to hoard more, etc.

The cure for this, it is argued, is for the central bank to pump money. By putting more cash in people’s hands, consumer confidence will increase, people will then spend more and the circular flow of money will reassert itself.

All this sounds very appealing, and various surveys of business activity show that during a recession businesses emphasize the lack of consumer demand as the major factor behind their poor performances.

Moreover, the share of people receiving incapacity benefits is also included to proxy those who cannot be active in the labour market due to health constraints. In unreported estimations, to capture the supply of medical services we tested the number of hospitals within 5 km, 10 km and 20 km radii of each municipality centroid.

Bacterial-incited plant diseases account for significant production losses to agricultural crops. Disease control is a major challenge as a result of various factors including pathogen variation, ability to overcome plant genetic resistance, lack of effective bactericides as a result of strains developing tolerance, and the pathogen's ability to reach high populations in a relatively short period of time when conditions are favorable for disease development. Antibiotics and copper-based compounds have been the principal bactericides used for disease control. Copper has been the most widely used bactericide; however, copper resistance is present in many plant pathogenic bacteria.[@R1]^-^[@R7] Antibiotics have also been used as part of a management strategy for various bacterial diseases since the 1950s.[@R8]^-^[@R10] Streptomycin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, was used extensively for control of bacterial diseases and as a result, streptomy",PubMed Central

4872," the NFL players who have taken a knee during the national anthem, but not the women whose job it is to root for the teams — the cheerleaders. They have been noticeably absent from the year-long drama that has divided football fans and outraged President Donald Trump and their reasons range from not wanting to undermine the team — to not wanting to lose their prized spot on the squad.

And even more ironically, the cheerleaders actually do suffer from a gender wage gap of sorts:

Doe said every cheer squad is managed and compensated differently. But the bottom line is that cheerleaders don’t do it for the money. The NFL is a $13 billion-dollar industry, but Doe said she and her squad mates took home approximately $100 a game. Kay said when she was a Chargers Girl, captains made $100 and cheerleaders made $75.

Yeah, you read that correctly. The players on the practice squad get $7,200 a week. Salary",OpenWebText2

the great mistake is that their employments are not exactly the same

state of affairs in Greenland, for there, too, the employments of the
two sexes are entirely distinct.

It is true that both sexes wear trousers, and have done so from
time immemorial; but nevertheless they have not yet attained to the
conception that there is little or no difference between men and women.

They hold that there are, among other things, certain essential physical
differences, and imagine that women are not as a rule so strong, active,
and courageous as men, and that they therefore are not so well fitted
for hunting and fishing. On the other hand, they do not think that men

## A POLICY VACUUM ON CLIMATE CHANGE

The mixture of rhetorical good intentions and inadequate or inappropriate policies produced the vacuum that was, and is, Canada's approach to climate change. Even if the policy prescriptions had been better and the political will more resolute, Canada would still have faced an uphill battle to reduce GHG emissions.

To better understand Canada's challenge, think about the different factors influencing output of GHGS. Everything else being equal, emissions rise with population, per capita income, and economic growth, and with the prominence of energy-intensive (especially fossil-fuel-intensive)",Books3

The identification of new miRNA-disease associations has significant biological implications and plays a key role in understanding the pathogenesis of diseases at the miRNA level. However, experimental methods are time-consuming and expensive, computational methods are good choice to solve the issue and predict potential miRNA-disease associations with high accuracy. In this work, we combine three different similarities of diseases and miRNAs to construct features of miRNA-disease associations and select 200 robust features by feature extraction.

In addition to this physical interest, KCMs are also mathematically challenging, because the presence of the constraints make them very different from classical Glauber dynamics and prevents the use of most of the usual tools.

So, for example, if you tell search engine bots to visit your page on a daily basis, but when it visits the page nothing has changed for a week, it may adjust the frequency of revisits accordingly and not return as often as you told it to. You can request, via the various webmasters portals, for the revisit rate to be amended if required.

This would suggest, therefore, that if you have regularly changing content, your website will be 'spidered' more frequently - leading to content being indexed quickly.

It is generally sensible to specify pages which are static to be crawled less frequently than those which change regularly. For example, a static text article might be crawled once a month, whereas your blog or news page may be crawled once a day or once a week, depending on how often you add new content.

Counterproductive, because capital investment fuels productivity gains and economic growth, and Usually futile, because capital owners have so many ways to avoid taxes and shunt the burden onto others.

The former argument has undeniably lost a little of its oomph in recent years. The influential papers that implied that the optimal rate of capital taxation is zero ( Atkinson and Stiglitz, 1976, Judd, 1985, and Chamley, 1986) have been contradicted by new theoretical models.

Hub Genes as Putative Candidates for Promoting Resilience

Here we identify two modules, the pink module and the darkgray module, as gene networks present early in disease that correlate with cognitive function later in life.

The downward trend of the yellow line is consistent with the negative correlation between the number of SNPs and the number of associated diseases of miRNAs. However, it should be noticed that reports of an association between a miRNA and disease are not independent and are expected to increase after the first report since studies of that miRNA will be motivated by existing results. Therefore, there are some biases in this analysis.

It’s a really great read. When people think of war or military, the main discourse tends to focus on staying alive or getting killed. We always hear in the news who died and who lived.

The most important of these factors is whether retroactivity will disappoint any reliance interest of the party against whom the new rule is being applied.  Here, the effect of retroactivity is to revive an action that the defendants once reasonably believed was barred.  In Wycoff, the effect of retroactivity was to defeat an action that a plaintiff had reasonably believed would not be barred.  The reliance interest asserted by the defendants here is, in our judgment, weaker than that asserted by the plaintiff in Wycoff, and the reasoning of our Wycoff opinion therefore requires that Wilson be applied retroactively here, just as it was there.

Iran’s mistake is part of the chain reaction that Trump set off when he approved the strike that killed Soleimani. If Trump doesn’t approve the strike on Soleimani, those airline passengers are probably still alive.

The problem with presidents who make up foreign policy as they go along is that they never anticipate the unintended consequences. Trump didn’t intend for 176 innocent people to die because of the events that he set into motion, but they did.

The team must respond to a simulated disaster as directed by the DRP. The scope of simulations will vary significantly; they tend to grow more complicated and involve more systems as smaller disaster simulations are successfully managed. Though some will see the goal as being able to successfully recover the systems impacted by the simulation, ultimately the goal of any testing of a DRP is to help ensure that the organization is well prepared in the event of an actual disaster.

At the relatively small Reynolds numbers achievable in DNS and at the relatively small filter widths used here, the standard models for the filtered pressure, the filtered heat flux, and the filtered species fluxes were found to yield accurate results for the morphology of the large-scale structures present in the flow. Analysis of the temporal evolution of several volume-averaged quantities representative of the mixing layer growth, and of the cross-stream variation of homogeneous-plane averages and second-order correlations, as well as of visualizations, indicated that the models performed equivalently for the conditions of the simulations.

It has been suggested that radiometers or power signal detection devices be employed to determine if periodically keyed random modulated signals are being transmitted. When such signals are received at a receiver it is often impossible to distinguish them from the receiver noise, thermal background noise, other transmitted signals and interfering emission signals. It is possible that the power level of the signals which are to be detected do not exceed the background noise and interference signals mentioned above. Thus, it is often impossible to employ radiometers and power detection devices to detect the presence of low power periodically keyed random modulated signals.
When a radiometer is employed to detect the presence of a signal, then the threshold of the detector must be set very close to the signal levels. Changes in either the interference levels or the threshold levels will affect the sensitivity of the receiver which results in false alarms or reduced sensitivity. For example, if a threshold of a radiometer is set to detect the desired signal at",USPTO Backgrounds

In addition very few objects in the post-AGB phase with the UIR bands have measured / data, including upper limits.

The overall shift pattern of the UIR band peaks is qualitatively in agreement with the isotopic shift pattern except for the 7.7$\mu$m band complex.

A plausible mechanism by which the people of Old Seoul City and other major East Asian cities might have suffered from high prevalence of parasite infections could also be constructed in this review.

In addition, such a childhood increases self-awareness, arousal, self-control, and calm, which are so important when responding to any emotion-laden situation.

Why isn't every vertex connected to every other vertex in TextRank?

I've been reading up on the automatic text summarization approach TextRank, particularly for generating summaries of a text using sentence extraction as opposed to keyword or phrase extraction.
In the published paper, an example body of text and the resulting ranked graph of all sentences/vertices and their edges is given. I'm unclear as to why every vertex doesn't have an edge connecting it to every other vertex in the graph - shouldn't all sentences be compared with each other?
This doesn't seem to be addressed in the paper. One possible explanation I've produced is that there is no edge if the similarity between two sentences is 0. Does anyone know for sure?

While mothers and fathers experience similar initial attachment behaviors with their infants, fathers use play as a way to get to know their infants differently than do mothers. This can be a sweet, engaging way of communicating with their infants. Holding, talking and using this gentle play is a way many men are comfortable beginning their relationships with their children.

The original MCC was proposed by Matthews ([@B42]), which was designed for binary classification and has wide applications (Chen et al., [@B8], [@B11]; Li et al., [@B36]). Here, two datasets (Dataset-1 and Dataset-2) contain more than two classes. Thus, the multi-class version of MCC was used, which was proposed by Gorodkin ([@B25]).

Coronaviruses (CoVs) can cause life-threatening respiratory diseases.

Fusion-inhibiting peptides bind to S proteins, interfere with refolding, and prevent infection. Here we conjugated fusion-inhibiting peptides to various lipids, expecting this to secure peptides onto cell membranes and thereby increase antiviral potencies. Cholesterol or palmitate adducts increased antiviral potencies up to 1000-fold.

In order to create solid, software architecture, we need to make the best use of existing components and follow proper design patterns. This is what we intend to deliver in this book.

This is not a general introduction book, and we expect our readers to have a basic understanding of the Backbone.js framework. If you are a beginner and looking for good resources to start with Backbone.js, we will recommend you to refer Appendix A, Books, Tutorials, and References, of this book, where we listed a number of useful resources to help you master Backbone.js.

Between May, 1988 and August, 1993, 158 patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) were treated radiosurgically at the University of Florida. A mean dose of 1560 cGy was directed to the periphery of the lesions, which had a mean volume of 9 cc (0.5 to 45.3 cc). One hundred thirty-nine of these individuals were treated with one isocenter. The mean follow-up interval was 33 months with clinical information available on 153 of these patients. Patients were followed until magnetic resonance (MR) studies suggested complete AVM thrombosis. An arteriogram was then performed, if possible, to verify occlusion status. If arteriography revealed any persistent nidus at 36 months posttreatment, the residual nidus was re-treated.

As a neonatal intensive care nurse, Lauren Bloomstein had been taking care of other people's babies for years. Finally, at 33, she was expecting one of her own. The prospect of becoming a mother made her giddy, her husband, Larry, recalled recently— ""the happiest and most alive I'd ever seen her.""

When Lauren was 13, her own mother had died of a massive heart attack. Lauren had lived with her older brother for a while, then with a neighbor in Hazlet, N.J., who was like a surrogate mom, but in important ways she'd grown up mostly alone.

Instead, he preferred once again to give Papen the task of forming a new government. But in fact Schleicher had already begun taking steps to succeed Papen. On 2 December he had his colleague Ott, just back from Weimar, present to the cabinet the results of a 'war games' exercise carried out by the Defence Ministry. In essence they boiled down to the fact that, in the event of a serious domestic or foreign crisis, the Reich's and federal states' security forces would be incapable of maintaining law and order in the face of the Nazis and communists. The study gave the clearest indication possible that the armed forces were no longer prepared to support Papen's policies, if necessary by introducing martial law. This presentation reinforced the cabinet's already existing inclination to appoint Schleicher Chancellor. The President appointed him the very same day.

Anyone interested in generating random beats or other elements in their music will have experimented with Ableton Live. They may not, however, have realized just how useful the Grain Delay is.

One of these would be the Grain Delay, which is possibly one of the most understated. Its plain packaging hides the fact that it is able to create some amazing textures and sounds from anything that you throw at it. In fact, I’ve used it to randomly generate sounds that have left people scratching their heads later in terms of how I actually did create them.

Concretely, if we added this to JS, we would add a new method `transfer()` you would get a new ArrayBuffer object where the backing memory is the same as the old one, but the old one is now detached, so any attempts to access the memory at the old one will throw an exception (or return undefined, in implementations). The transferred one (lexically scoped and private to the current function) has a reference to the memory area but is fully functional. (Points to example using transfer()). This doesn't have to copy or detach, and makes the operation fast. You can transfer without having to save the result anywhere. Any thoughts?

As described further in the ""[Methods](#Sec16){ref-type=""sec""}"" and the Additional file [1](#MOESM1){ref-type=""media""}, for every CPT that was to be populated by subjective opinion, we first assigned a numerical score/weight to every possible combination of parent node states. We then derived the probability distribution for that combination of states from a probability distribution table containing the distributions for all possible scores. These pre-defined probability distribution tables were carefully constructed to be symmetrically balanced around the middle score. The main advantage of using this method is that a consistent way of populating opinion-based CPTs was achieved.

Applications for this year’s Small Biz 100 open on June 1 – and I’m passionate about seeing as many WiRE women as possible put forward their case to be featured this year.

The Small Biz 100 are chosen each year by the UK’s Small Business Saturday movement.

Small Business Saturday is a grassroots, non-commercial campaign, which highlights small business success and encourages people to support the small, independent businesses in their communities. Although the day itself takes place on the first Saturday in December each year – the campaign aims to change mindsets and have a lasting impact on small businesses all year round.

The Small Biz 100 are announced in a national newspaper and then, in the 100 days leading up to Small Business Saturday, each one gets a day in the national spotlight.

For I am full of it, and can think of hardly anything sensible to say about it except unending praise. When Goethe says that to praise is presumptuous he is right, as always.

That had the additional benefit of getting rid of one of Britain's top spies, as part of the same operation. So far as he knew, the whole operation which he had meticulously planned and executed, had gone exactly to plan.

The mystery now, though, was why the British authorities had not yet announced the death of one of their most eminent nuclear physicists.

We are in Tanlili, a large village of 2,600 people in the rural district of Zitenga, northwest of Ouagadougou, the capital city of Burkina Faso. Tanlili means “hidden by mountains” in Mooré, a local language. The village is hilly and the soils are dark red and eroded. It is the dry season, and there are few plants apart from shea trees, which stretch as far as the eye can see.

But in this village, farmers have successfully restored the degraded lands with traditional techniques such as zai, demi-lunes and stone lines. Hamidou Ouédraogo is the chairman of the union of village associations. He explains.

Rehabilitative alimony may be appropriate when one spouse is exiting the marriage with few job skills and limited earning capacity.[23] An award of rehabilitative alimony should be designed to support the spouse while she receives the training and education necessary for her to become self-supporting.[24]
A number of the findings made by the trial court suggest that the court in making the award in question was motivated at least in part by considerations relevant to rehabilitative alimony. The court noted that Margaret did not pursue a career during the marriage and instead raised the parties' two children. Her earning capacity at the time of trial was roughly $10,000 per year, and she was unable to find satisfactory year-round employment.

It is thought that the senescence accelerated mouse (SAM) strains are very useful for examination of the aging mechanism. In particular, SAMP8 is useful since this substrain shows age-related deterioration of learning ability. One of the most attractive hypotheses of aging is that aging is a result of long-term exposure to free radicals generated through the glucose metabolism, and it is possible that oxygen radicals might be involved in the aging mechanism of SAM. In the present study, to elucidate the relation between free radicals and aging acceleration in SAMP8, we examined the changes in food intake, body weight and spontaneous motor activity.

The CBOE’s BZX Equity Exchange published a notice on January 23, saying that it pulled its request to change a rule that could allow it to list a Bitcoin ETF. The ETF is supported by investment firm VanEck and financial services company SolidX.

VanEck’s CEO Jan van Eck said on CNBC that the shutdown affected the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which in turn dragged the process of seeking approval for the ETF.

“We were engaged in discussions with the SEC about the Bitcoin-related issues, custody, market manipulation, prices, and that had to stop,” he said.

Although no money was reportedly lost as a result, Stellar’s major issue has now been highlighted publicly: The project is not decentralized, at least not to the extent expected at this point. Notably, the offline scenario was predicted by researchers earlier last month.

Brief introduction to Stellar and its network

Stellar is a platform for money remittance. It was launched in 2014 by Jed McCaleb, founder of Mt. Gox and co-founder of Ripple, and former lawyer Joyce Kim. Stellar’s native asset is the lumen (XLM), currently the ninth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.

The Stellar network, in turn, is designed as a decentralized peer-to-peer network of validator nodes. Stellar Core software is used by the nodes to confirm transactions.

The dielectric substrate contains uniformly dispersed materials, organic or inorganic, which are attacked by oxidizing or caustic reagents and preferentially etched out from the substrate to form the rough surface needed for plating. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,152,477, a butadiene-based rubber adhesive is etched away from hardened phenolic resin microcapsules dispersed in the rubber to provide increased surface area from the presence of the high number of small particles exposed. A characteristic of all these etch-out approaches is that the substrate or adhesive is limited to a narrow range of fillers or matrix materials, thus limiting applicability to a narrow range of substrates, or compromising other properties needed by high performance circuits.

Rather, we argue that the network is *sufficient* to produce these phenomena, and we note that explicit representation of prediction errors in units within the feedforward path of the PredNet provides a straightforward explanation for the transient nature of responses in visual cortex in response to static images. That a single, simple objective—prediction—can produce such a wide variety of observed neural phenomena underscores the idea that prediction may be a central organizing principle in the brain [@Rao_1999], and points toward fruitful directions for future study in both neuroscience and machine learning.

Neuronal basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors such as neuroD and neurogenin have been shown to play important roles in neuronal development. In the present study, several distinct bHLH DNA fragments were isolated from the zebrafish genomic DNA by a pair of degenerate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers deduced from the conserved bHLH domains of neuroD and neurogenins. Based on the bHLH fragments, three complete neuroD-related cDNA clones, including complete coding regions, ndr1a, ndr1b, and ndr2 (ndr for neuroD related), were isolated and assembled by 5' and 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE).

The mean pH(i) of cleavage-stage embryos was 7.12 +/- 0.008 (n = 199) with little variation between different stages. Embryos demonstrated robust recovery from alkalosis that was appropriately Cl(-)-dependent, indicating the presence of the HCO(3)(-)/Cl(-) exchanger.

For the reason that iPhone SE’s battery is simply a smidgen bigger, I did not have high hopes, even supposing Apple advised me battery life is 50% higher than the outdated flagship’s.

The essential part is that, like the Samsung Galaxy S7, the OnePlus three has very quick twin-channel RAM, which makes accessing RAM information faster than the primary DDR4 phones. More problematic is Apple’s continued insistence that 16GB of storage is enough for an entry-degree telephone as of late.

In all cases, the anamnesis of a resonance constructed by the method proposed in this work provides an excellent description of localized aspects of the resonant wave function in a broad range of resonance widths. The so defined resonance anamnesis becomes an image of the resonance wave function in the subspace of ${\cal L}^2$-functions. Its removal from the subspace of scattering wave functions leaves only the non-resonant continuum with smoothly varying phase shifts. This feature of resonance-anamnesis wave functions give them a special significance in a decomposition of the scattering continuum.

The chosen operating point is maintained by controlling the distances between the electrodes and the material to be melted. This is generally done by means of impedance regulation b forming an actual impedance value for each electrode from continuously measured electrical variables such as the phase voltage and the phase current, and using the error between this actual impedance value and a predetermined set impedance value to define a manipulated variable for adjusting the height of the respective electrode.

abstract: 'We consider multiple time scales systems of stochastic differential equations with small noise in random environments. We prove a quenched large deviations principle with explicit characterization of the action functional. The random medium is assumed to be stationary and ergodic. In the course of the proof we also prove related quenched ergodic theorems for controlled diffusion processes in random environments that are of independent interest. The proof relies entirely on probabilistic arguments, allowing to obtain detailed information on how the rare event occurs. We derive a control, equivalently a change of measure, that leads to the large deviations lower bound. This information on the change of measure can motivate the design of asymptotically efficient Monte Carlo importance sampling schemes for multiscale systems in random environments.'

Let Marijuana Travel Between States If Guns Can, Dem Congressman Says

Medical MarijuanaPosted Dec 14 2017

A new bill being pushed by Republicans this month would allow those with concealed carry gun permits to carry their weapons across state lines even if the destination state has different requirements for concealed carry. The Democrats are hoping by that same logic that Republicans will begin supporting medical marijuana patients and their ability to take their medication across state lines. There's no good reason that an American medical patient shouldn't be able to travel across state lines with their legal medication that treats their illness. If Republicans truly believe in and support federalism and and state's rights, then they should also be in favor of state legal medications crossing state lines.

The altercation began as a result of Zetterberg tying up Benn with a stick between the legs and a left-hand shoulder wrap after the Stars captain won the draw back toward the top of the face-off circle.

Therefore, to avoid the presentation of abnormal NNs inversion values caused by the non-vegetation pixels, it was a good strategy to remove non-vegetation pixels using NDVI threshold value before LAI estimation using the NNs. In this study, the NDVI threshold value of 0.05 was used to distinguish vegetation and non-vegetation pixels. The pixels with NDVI value smaller than 0.05 was identified as non-vegetation pixels and LAI would be set to zero, whereas the LAI for other pixels would be estimated using the trained NNs, from which the GF-1 WFV data should be judged from that sensor and then adopt the corresponding trained NNs.

Although most studies of PP1--I-2 have been performed in vitro, robust and persistent pT72 phosphorylation is observed in the early phase of mitosis and is correlated with (1) robust and sustained PP1 inhibitory phosphorylation (pT320), and (2) robust and sustained phosphorylation of histone 3 (at serine 10), a known PP1 substrate ([@bib30]). This raises the possibility that in vivo PP1 phosphorylation at T320, which inhibits PP1, might trap I-2--PP1 in a state where I-2 is phosphorylated at T72. Irrespective, PP1 phosphorylation at T320 and I-2 phosphorylation at T72 can be used independently as markers for the level of PP1 activity in the I-2--PP1 complex.

============

Extensive characterization of cancer genomes has begun to change the classification of neoplasms and the choice of therapies ([@bib20]). The genetic profiles of most cancers are notoriously heterogeneous, often including thousands of mutations affecting genes with a wide range of credentials\-\--from those well-known to drive oncogenic behavior to those not known to have a role in pathogenesis. Moreover, cancers continue to accumulate mutations during carcinogenesis, producing tumor subclones with selectable features such as drug resistance or enhanced growth potential ([@bib39]).

Despite this heterogeneity, consistent patterns have been observed, such as the high frequency of gain-of-function or loss-of-function mutations affecting specific proto-oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes in cancers that arise in certain cell lineages. Conversely, coincident mutations in certain genes are rare, even when those genes are frequently mutated individually in specific types of cancer ([@",PubMed Central

Cox argued that the rule of law need not be upheld to traditional standards in this situation because (1) these fighters engaged with the Canadian state in an arena in which the Canadian state was not the sole user of coercive force, and (2) because of the prosecution of these individuals constitutes a continuation of the attempt of the Canadian state to destroy these fighters.

The encoder--decoder segmentation architecture converged to a validation center location error of 0.9 px (Fig. [2a--c](#Fig2){ref-type=""fig""}). Surprisingly, we found the binned classification network displayed unstable loss curves, indicating overfitting and poor generalization (Fig. [2b, e](#Fig2){ref-type=""fig""}). The regression architecture converged to a validation center location error of 1.2 px, showing a better training than validation performance (Fig. [2a, b, d](#Fig2){ref-type=""fig""}). We further investigated the performance of posture predictions on the segmentation and regression networks. A commonly used metric for this task is calculating the Intersection over Union (IoU) score for a prediction relative to a ground",PubMed Central
